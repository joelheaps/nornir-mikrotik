# nornir-mikrotik
Nornir scripts for managing MikroTik RouterOS and SwitchOS devices

These scripts are admittedly written for some very specific use cases, and function is certainly emphasized over form.  They may serve as useful examples for anyone automating MikroTik devices with Nornir.
Particularly interesting is the use of Python's Selenium web interface to automate some functions on MikroTik SwitchOS devices, which only have a web UI.
